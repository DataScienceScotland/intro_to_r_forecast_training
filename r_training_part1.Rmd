## Module 1 - Introduction to R

#### In this session we will cover:

1.  Introducing concepts
2.  Writing R code
3.  Running your code
4.  Setting up a working directory
5.  Importing packages
6.  Use cases/benefits of using R
7.  Additional resources - R vs SAS terminology

### Introduction to R

#### Introducing concepts

R is one of the most widely used softwares in data science. Several
interfaces for R have been developed and these are referred to as
integrated development environments (IDE), which allow for software
development. We will use the RStudio IDE as it is widely used in the
community and makes learning to use R a bit simpler.

$~$

#### Writing R code

While you can type and re-type commands in the R Console, it is easier
and more effective to write the commands in a **R script** file, which
can then be run. **R markdown** (free and open source) allows you to
easily create dynamic documents, presentations and reports from R. It
combines markdown (simple formatting syntax) and embedded R code chunks
that are run. You can install the R markdown package from CRAN with:

```{r echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```

We will come back to creating an R markdown file and what it entails.
**R Notebook** is similar to R markdown, but used more as a notebook for
yourself. When viewing a notebook preview, it doesn't execute any of
your R code chunks.

R has 2 widely used methods of assignment:

-   the left arrow (`<-`)
-   the equals sign (`=`)

A `#` is the comment character in R and so anything following this
character is ignored. We will start by giving an example of running an R
code block.

$~$

#### Running your code

You can run your R code by either highlighting the area and pressing
**'Ctrl + Enter'**, running the whole code 'block' by clicking on the
little **arrow** or selecting **'Run'** at the top of your R script.

```{r running_code, echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Assigning a variable
y <- 20

# Multiplying variable by 76
answer = y * 76

# Obtaining answer to variable
paste0("The answer of ", y, " x 76 is ", answer)
```

$~$

#### Setting up a working directory

For the handling of files, RStudio uses a working directory, which is a
folder where RStudio reads and saves files. Before we start writing any
code we should set up a working directory so that everything we want to
import/export is saved by default in this folder.

```{r setting_wd, echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# To check what your current wd is
getwd()

# To change wd
setwd("...")

# OR Session > Set Working Directory > Choose Directory 
```

$~$

#### Importing packages

There are many ways of doing the same thing in R. Some are
(computationally) faster, some are simpler to program or may just be
more applicable to your personal preference. Packages are a set of
functions and files that relate to a specific toolset, which extend the
functionality provided by R. For example, a very popular package
**tidyverse** (umbrella package which contains **dplyr**) is recommended
for data manipulation and will be used throughout this course. You can
install packages using the commands below or by going to the
**'Packages'** tab followed by **'Install'** in RStudio.

```{r import_packages, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE}
# Install package
install.packages("tidyverse")

# To load package 
library(tidyverse)

# To learn more about a package 
?dplyr
```

```{r include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

Once a package is installed you should be able to see it in the packages
tab.

## Module 2 - Publication Ready Reproducible Analysis

#### In this session we will cover:

1.  Working with R markdown
2.  Outputs of R markdown

### Publication Ready Reproducible Analysis

#### Working with R markdown

So just to recap, R markdown is a file format for making dynamic
documents with R. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax which can be
used to create HTML, PDF and Word documents.\
What we have been working on is an R markdown document, and as you can
see we can incorporate plain text format and chunks of code into it.

$~$

Markdown is a set of conventions for formatting plain text. You can use
markdown to indicate

-   **Bold** and *italic* text (using two asterisks surrounding text to
    make it bold \*\*TEXT\*\* or using one asterisks for italicized text
    \*TEXT\*)

-   lists (group lines into bullet points that begin with an
    asterisks/hyphen/number and leave a black space before your first
    item in the list)

-   headers (place one or more hashtags (\#) at the start of a line that
    will be a header (or sub-header).

    -   a single hashtag creates a first level header
    -   two hashtags create a second level header etc..

-   hyperlinks (Surround links with brackets, and then provide the link
    target in parentheses, like this [R Markdown
    information](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com))

A useful markdown [cheat
sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/main/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf).

$~$

Now that we've covered how to add text in markdown, lets look at how
chunks of code work. When creating a new chunk of R code we need to
encapsulate it as follows:

\`\`\`{r}

print('text')

\`\`\`

which will render;

```{r}
print('text')
```

Within markdown, you can give your code blocks different names, to
easily identify which code block you are referring to or, which code
block is creating an error. You can also

-   change the figure width,
-   show code and output,
-   only show output (no code),
-   only show code (no output),
-   show nothing, but run code
-   show warning messages/loading messages

$~$

For example, if you set `echo = FALSE`, this prevents the code but not
the results from appearing in the finished file, which is a useful way
to embed figures.

```{r codeblock_example, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE}
# {r code_block_descriptions, echo = TRUE, fig.width = 14} 
# fig.width = changes figure width (arbitrary is 7) 

# eval = TRUE (controls whether to execute a code chunk) 
# echo = TRUE (only get output/ not code)

# error = FALSE, R markdown will halt in code chunk and error displayed in R console
# message = FALSE (suppress messages appearing in finished doc)
# warning = FALSE (suppress messages appearing in finished doc)
```

$~$

#### Outputs of R markdown

When you click the **'Knit'** button, a document will be generated that
includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code
chunks within the document. Depending on how you have specified the
`output` parameter at the top of the document, will determine whether
your markdown file should render as an HTML, PDF or Word document.

## Module 3 - Getting data into/out of R

#### In this session we will cover:

1.  The dataframe as the basis of analysis
2.  Reading data from csv, excel and Rda files
3.  Viewing data in R
4.  Indexing
5.  Setting column names and types
6.  Saving data

We will be using a variation of the Melbourne Property prices dataset,
which can be found
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/melbourne-housing-snapshot?resource=download)
on Kaggle. This dataset includes house prices, number of bedrooms, the
area, date it was sold and how it was sold.

### Getting data into/out of R

#### The data frame as the basis of analysis

In R, a dataframe (df) is a list of equal length vectors where each
vector is a column and represents a variable. It is the most common way
of storing data and used to store data tables.

$~$

#### Reading data from csv, excel and Rda files

Although you can create your own dataframes in R, it will be common for
you to read in data from a csv (or other) files. To do this, we can use
the `read_csv()` to load a csv data file. We would assign the result of
our `read_csv()` to an object. For example;

`dataset = readr::read_csv(filepath_to_your_csv)`

$~$

We can also use the `read_excel()` function to load xls and xlsx files.

`dataset = readxl::read_excel(filepath_to_your_xls)`

$~$

An R data file, just needs to be loaded using the `load()` command.

The code used here assumes that the files are in your working directory.
If this is not the case, you will need to include the file path.

```{r read_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# To load package (have tidyverse installed)
library(readr)
melb_data_csv <- readr::read_csv("data/melb_data.csv")

library(readxl)
melb_data_excel <- readxl::read_excel("data/melb_data.xlsx")

# Creating a new df to do work on
melb_data <- melb_data_csv

# To load an Rda file
load("data/melb_data.Rda")
```

$~$

#### Viewing data in R

Your data set can be viewed in a number of different ways. Some of these
are given below.

```{r view_data, , echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# To view the df
View(melb_data)

# Obtain a summary of the df meta-data (more detailed)
str(melb_data)

# Useful details and information about each column in df
summary(melb_data)

# Get first few rows of df
head(melb_data)
```

$~$

#### Indexing

An index is like an address, that's how any data point across the
dataframe can be accessed. Square brackets (`[ ]`) can be used to subset
the data.

For e.g. `melb_data[i, j]` would return the value in the ith row and jth
column of the melb_data dataframe.

You can also find the first 3 variables for say the 100th observation
and use the colon operator to create a sequence.

```{r , echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Column information for 100th row in 2nd column
melb_data[100, 2]

# Second variable for the 100th and 102th obs, can concatenate c()
melb_data[c(100, 102), 2]

# First 3 variables for the 100th obs - retrieve 1st to 3rd variable
melb_data[100, 1:3]
melb_data['Address']

# To view a specific variable 
melb_data$Price

```

$~$

#### Setting column names and types

All variables have an associated class and the class helps determine
which calculations are possible and how these can be performed by R. The
different class types that exist include;

-   **logical** = TRUE/FALSE
-   **double** = numeric (all values are double, incl decimal value)
-   **integer** = numeric
-   **character**
-   **factor**

You can check what whether a variable is of the type you specified by,
for example, saying; `is.logical()`, `is.character()`, `is.integer()` or
`is.numeric()`.

These all return `TRUE` or `FALSE`. Alternatively if you don't have any
idea as to what the variable class could be, you can identify the type
of column using `typeof()` or `class`. Our dataset currently has 2
different classes: **numeric** and **character**.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Class Information for individual column
class(melb_data$Date)

# Class Information for whole dataframe
sapply(melb_data, class)
```

We can change the class type of a column. For example, from the
information, we see that the class type of the *'Date'* variable is
**character**. We can change it to be of class **date**, using the
following code;

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Change class type
melb_data$Date = as.Date(melb_data$Date, format = "%d/%m/%Y")

# Checking class type has changed
sapply(melb_data, class)
```

If we had variables which were recognised as being integers, but we
wanted them to be categorical, we could do the
following;

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
melb_data$Type = as.factor(melb_data$Type)
levels(melb_data$Type)
```

We can also change the column names, using `colnames()`.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Setting column names
colnames(melb_data)[6] <- "Bedroom"
```

$~$

#### Saving data

Say you have done any changes you want to and are now wanting to save
your data. You can save it as a csv, excel or Rda file. This can be done
by using `write.csv()` and `write.xlsx()`. Bear in mind the argument
`row.names` is by default set to `TRUE` (and means it will add the row
names as a column to your data) and that columns are separated by a
comma. If you do not want to export row headers, set this condition to
`FALSE`.

```{r message=TRUE, warning=TRUE, echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Save as csv
write.csv(melb_data, "data/melb_data_edited.csv", row.names = FALSE)

# Save as xlsx
library("writexl")
writexl::write_xlsx(melb_data, "data/melb_data_edited.xlsx")

# Save as Rda
save(melb_data, file = "data/melb_data_edited.Rda")
```

## Module 4 - Data Manipulation

#### In this session we will cover:

1.  Difference between base R and dplyr
2.  Filtering and subsetting
3.  Grouping and summarising data

### Data Manipulation

#### Difference between base R and dplyr

We will look
at the differences between **base R** and **dplyr** before going on to
apply both of these methods to some of the data.

**Base R** is the basic software which contains the R programming
language and all the basic functions.

**Dplyr** is an R-package to transform and summarise tabular data and
provides easy tools to do this.

$~$

#### Filtering and subsetting

Usually we are interested in doing analysis or finding out information
about a subset of our data. First we will be working with filtering and
selecting.

Often you will see people use the pipe operator (`%>%`) - this is a
feature of tidyverse. Here the data is 'piped' into a command. For
example, if you wanted to extract certain column(s) from your dataframe,
you could do the following:

```{r data_subset, echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Select Address column
# dplyr
melb_data %>% dplyr::select(Address)

# base R
subset(melb_data, select = c(Address))

# Select all columns except Address column
# dplyr
melb_data %>% dplyr::select(-c(YearBuilt))

# base R
subset(melb_data, select = -c(YearBuilt))
```

Notice how you don't need to specify the dataset in the select command
with dplyr. This is because R interprets the dataframe (`melb_data`) as
being the first argument (and the one to perform operations on).

The pipe operator can make code more readable by allowing us to connect
multiple functions so you don't need to reference your dataframe each
time you run a command or use a nested function (function within another
function).

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Filter data to only have houses priced under 1mill in Albert Park with at least 2 bedrooms
# dplyr
melb_data %>% 
  dplyr::filter(Price < 1000000,
                Bedroom >= 2,
                Suburb == 'Albert Park') 

# base r
melb_data[melb_data$Price < 1000000 & 
            melb_data$Bedroom >= 2 & 
            melb_data$Suburb == 'Albert Park', ]
```

You can see some more of the differences between using base R and dplyr
[here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/base.html).
Going forward, we will use dplyr, as it is commonly used in industry.

$~$

#### Grouping and summarising data

Grouped operations are a powerful way to aggregate, transform, and
filter data. They rely on the mantra of **"split-apply-combine"**:

1.  Data is split into separate parts based on groups
2.  A function is applied to each part of the data
3.  The results from each part are combined to create a new data set.

This is a powerful concept because parts of your original data can be
split up into independent parts to perform a calculation. We can create
summary statistics and breakdown the data using commands from the dplyr
package;

-   `group_by()`: *which variables we want to produce breakdowns by*
-   `summarise()`: *indicate which values to calculate*

Using the above functions we can produce summary statistics in a similar
way to pivot tables in Excel. So let's get the average house price with
breakdown by Suburb. Here R takes the `melb_dataset` and groups it by
*Suburb* and outputs the average house price by Suburb. The mean price
variable created has been called *'Average_Price_Suburb'* and the
results are saved into a new dataset called *'suburb_price_avg'*. Here
we could have also used `min()`, `max()`, `median()` or `n()` instead of
`mean()`.

```{r , echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
suburb_price_avg = melb_data %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(Suburb) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(Average_Price_Suburb = mean(Price))
```

Let's add a new variable called *'Count'* which provides the counts of
Houses in Melbourne by the Suburb. We then extract the most expensive
Suburbs, together with the number of Properties in that Suburb.

```{r , echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
suburb_price_avg = melb_data %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(Suburb) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(Average_Price_Suburb = mean(Price), Count = n()) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(desc(Average_Price_Suburb))

head(suburb_price_avg)
```

$~$

##### Mutate

If we want to add a new variable to our dataset that gives the year a
house was sold, we can do this using a `mutate()` command, which
extracts the year from the date to perform analysis on.

```{r , echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
melb_data = melb_data %>%
  dplyr::mutate(Year = format(Date, format = "%Y"))

```

$~$

##### If else

The `if_else()` statement (in the **dplyr** package) works in a similar
way to if statements in Excel, where it uses a logical statement to
identify the output. Below we are identifying properties whose price is
under 1 million, the mutate function is used together with the
`if_else()` function to add a variable to the Melbourne dataset, where

$$price\_under\_1mill =\begin{cases} 1 & if \ house \ price < 1 \ million \\
                     0 &   if \ house \ price \geq 1 \ million
       \end{cases}$$

```{r , echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
melb_data %>%
  dplyr::mutate(price_under_1mill = if_else(Price < 1000000, 1 , 0)) 
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Save as csv
write.csv(melb_data, "data/melb_data_edited.csv", row.names = FALSE)

# Save as xlsx
writexl::write_xlsx(melb_data, "data/melb_data_edited.xlsx")

# Save as Rda
save(melb_data, file = "data/melb_data_edited.Rda")
```

$~$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Exercises - Module 4

#### 1) Looking at property prices, answer the following questions

-   What is the Region that has sold a property for the highest price?

-   What is the Region that has sold a property for the lowest price?

-   What is the mean and median property price?

```{r}

```

$~$

#### 2) We will now be looking at the price of each square meter of Building and Land.

-   First remove rows with zeros given for Land or Building Area.

-   Then create a new variable that calculates the price of each square
    meter of Building and Land.

-   Then find the Region with the most and least expensive square meter
    of Building and Land.

```{r}

```

$~$

#### 3) Drop the following variables:

-   Latitude
-   Longitude
-   Postcode
-   Address
-   Method

```{r}

```

$~$

#### 4) (Optional) Answer 2 questions on the data where possible using the filter, arrange and group_by() method.

-   What is the average price for a property with 5 rooms overall? 


```{r}

  
```

- What is the average price for a property with 5 rooms by property type?


```{r}

```

#### 5) (Optional) Create a new variable in the dataset

- Using the mutate and case_when method, create a new variable in the dataset that will indicate whether properties are in the high (\>1 mil), medium (500k - 1mil) and low (\< 500k) priced buckets. 

- How many properties are in each bucket?

*Tip: Use the group by and summarise functions to help you*
