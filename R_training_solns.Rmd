**This document contains all solutions to the different exercises. You will need to have imported your data and performed any necessary transformations before completing the exercises**


### Exercises - Module 3

$~$

#### 1) SellerG appears to be a numeric variable - convert it to a categorical variable


```{r}
melb_data$SellerG = as.factor(melb_data$SellerG)
```

$~$

#### 2) Rename the column SellerG to Seller.

```{r}
data.table::setnames(melb_data, "SellerG", "Seller")
```

$~$

#### 3) Which Seller has sold the most properties overall? 

```{r}
summary(melb_data$Seller) # Nelson sold the most properties overall (763)
```

$~$

#### 4) What is the lowest and highest price a property has been sold for?

```{r}
summary(melb_data$Price) # Min: 131000, Max: 9000000
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Exercises - Module 4

#### 1) Looking at Property Prices, answer the following questions

-   What is the Region that has sold a property for the highest price? 

```{r}
# Region with highest price - South Eastern Metropolitan
melb_data %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(desc(Price)) %>%
  dplyr::slice(1)
```

-   What is the Region that has sold a property for the lowest price? 

```{r}
# Region with lowest price - Southern Metropolitan
melb_data %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(Price) %>%
  dplyr::slice(1)

# Or to get both highest and lowest priced area
melb_data %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(desc(Price)) %>%
  dplyr::slice(c(1, (n()-1)))

```

-   What is the mean and median property price?

```{r}
# To get mean and median of a variable
mean(melb_data$Price)
median(melb_data$Price)
```

#### 2) We will now be looking at the price of each square meter of Building and Land. 

- First remove rows with zeros given for Land or Building Area. 

- Then create a new variable that calculates the price of each square meter of Building and Land.

```{r}
# Remove building and land size of 0
melb_data_newcols = melb_data %>%
  dplyr::filter(Landsize != 0,
         BuildingArea != 0) %>%
  # Create new variables
  dplyr::mutate(price_land_area = Price/Landsize,
         price_building_area = Price/BuildingArea)
```


- Then find the Region with the most and least expensive square meter of Building and Land. 

```{r}
# Most expensive region by land price is Southern Metropolitan and least expensive is Western Metropolitan
melb_data_newcols %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(desc(price_land_area)) %>%
  dplyr::slice(c(1, (n()-1)))

# Most expensive region by land price is Southern Metropolitan and least expensive is Western Metropolitan
melb_data_newcols %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(desc(price_building_area)) %>%
  dplyr::slice(c(1, (n()-1)))
```

#### 3) Drop the following variables:

-   Latitude
-   Longitude
-   Postcode
-   Address
-   Method

```{r}
melb_data_refined = melb_data_newcols %>%
  dplyr::select(-c(Lattitude, Longtitude, Postcode, Address, Method))
```

#### 4) (Optional) Answer 2 questions on the data where possible using the filter, arrange and group_by() method.

-   What is the Average price for a property with 5 rooms overall?

```{r}
# 1960689
melb_data_refined %>%
  dplyr::filter(Rooms == 5) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(Rooms) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(Avg_Price = mean(Price))

```

- What is the Average price for a property with 5 rooms by Property type?

```{r}
# h= 1972224.8 and t= 891666.7
melb_data_refined %>%
  dplyr::filter(Rooms == 5) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(Type) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(Avg_Price = mean(Price))
```

#### 5) (Optional) Create a new variable in the dataset

- Using the mutate and case_when method, create a new variable in the dataset that will indicate whether properties are in the high (\>1 mil), medium (500k - 1mil) and low (\< 500k) priced buckets. 

```{r}
melb_data_cleaned = melb_data %>%
  dplyr::mutate(Price_band = case_when(
    Price < 500000  ~ "low",
    Price < 1000000 & Price >= 500000 ~ "medium",
    TRUE ~ "high"
  ))
```

- How many properties are in each bucket?

*Tip: Use the group by and summarise functions to help you*

```{r}
melb_data_cleaned %>%
  dplyr::group_by(Price_band) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(Count = n())
```

$~$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Exercises - Module 5 

#### 1) Create a histogram using the Melbourne dataset on the distance from city center. Use either base r or ggplot.

```{r}
hist(x = melb_cleaned_data$Distance)
```

-   Change the colour (use any colour except the default grey)
-   (Extra) Add a chart title
-   (Extra) Add x and y-axis labels

```{r}
# Using base R
hist(x = melb_cleaned_data$Distance, 
     xlab = 'Distance', ylab = 'Counts', 
     main = 'Histogram of distance from city centre', 
     col = 'lightblue')
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Using ggplot
ggplot(data = melb_cleaned_data, aes(x = Distance)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "black", 
                 fill = "lightblue", na.rm = TRUE) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Counts") +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Distance") +
  ggtitle(label = "Histogram of distance from city centre")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Exercises - Module 7

$~$

#### 1) Create a simple function

-   Convert property prices from dollars to pounds. *(Tip: Check the mean price of property prices before and after you use your function to check that it has worked)*

```{r}
# This function will convert dollars into pounds using a specified rate

convert_dollars_into_pounds <- function(df, variable, rate){
  # @param df: dataframe with data
  # @param variable: string to indicate the variable name that must be converted
  # @param rate: specified rate to apply the conversion from dollars to pounds
  
  df['Price_pounds'] = df[variable]*rate
  
  return (df)
}
```

```{r}
melb_data_pounds = convert_dollars_into_pounds(
  df = melb_data, variable = 'Price',
                            rate = 0.71)
```

```{r}
mean(melb_data$Price)
mean(melb_data_pounds$Price_pounds)

```

$~$

#### 2) Place control flows in your function to prevent function failing or returning a nonsensical answer.

-   Ensure the variable passed into the function exists in the dataset given.
-   Ensure the rate is within realistic bounds.

```{r}
# This function will convert dollars into pounds using a specified rate

convert_dollars_into_pounds <- function(df, variable, rate){
  # @param df: dataframe with data
  # @param variable: string to indicate the variable name that must be converted
  # @param rate: specified rate to apply the conversion from dollars to pounds
  if(rate > 10 | rate < -10){
    if(variable %in% colnames(df)){
      df['Price_pounds'] = df[variable]*rate
     } else {
        df<-df
        print(paste0("Price_pounds could not be created. Variable ", variable," does not exist in dataframe ", df, "."))
    }
  } else {
    print(paste0("Price_pounds could not be created. This is outside accepted bounds. Please choose rate between -10 and 10", "Rate provided: ", rate, "."))
  }
  
  
  return (df)
}
```

```{r}
melb_data_pounds = convert_dollars_into_pounds(
  df = melb_data, variable = 'Made_Up_Variable',
                            rate = 0.71)
```

```{r}
melb_data_pounds = convert_dollars_into_pounds(
  df = melb_data, variable = 'Price',
                            rate = 15)
```
